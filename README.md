## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This GitHub repo is intended to make available the data and tools that were used for the paper "Dimension 8 Operators in WW production via gluon fusion" [arXiv: 2412.16020]. To this end we provide the raw data which was generated with MCFM-RE and MATRIX (please see documentation within to run these programs). We also provide a the tool used to generate the contour plots both with current data and with pseudodata.
